So you dont have this-> everywhere in source code, layer class must be pure abstract class, look at caffe's implementation for more details

Networks which work successfully in floating point:
	DcNet
	GoogleNet
	Vgg16
	

Networks which still need work in floating point:
	AlexNet     Output is verifed up to before fully connected layers
    SqueezeNet  (Needs global Pooling)
    
    
Networks which work successfully in fixed point:
	DcNet
	Vgg16
	

Networks which still need work in fixed point:
    GoogleNet   fix norm layer
	AlexNet     fix norm layer
    SqueezeNet  (Needs global Pooling)
