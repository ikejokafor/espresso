Networks which still need work in floating point:
    SqueezeNet  (Needs global Pooling)

when using partial maps, may not need to send data back, deserialize output maps, copy to partial maps, and reserialize
    may be bale to keep data on accel, or if you send it back, may not need to deserialize, instead just set partial map buffer to outputMaps
    
    
The start address of all axi transactions must be multiples of 512 bits (ie 64 bytes, ie the lower 6 bits must be zero)
    During the transaction they must not cross 4KB boundaries

Fix code for generating 3x3 kernel addresses. 3x3 Kernels are loaded only once, so need an array of addresses for each quad where each element
of the array is an address for 3x3 kernels for each QUAD. Same goes for the bias
