Networks which still need work in floating point:
    SqueezeNet  (Needs global Pooling)

when using partial maps, may not need to send data back, deserialize output maps, copy to partial maps, and reserialize
    may be bale to keep data on accel, or if you send it back, may not need to deserialize, instead just set partial map buffer to outputMaps
